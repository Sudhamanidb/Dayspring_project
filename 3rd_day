📅 Day 3 – Rails Concepts & File Structure
🔹 Main Features of Rails

Convention over Configuration

Syntactic Sugar

Rails auto-creates MVC components when naming is correct

🔹 Naming Conventions

Model → Singular (Customer)

Controller → Plural (CustomersController)

Table → Plural (customers)

🔹 Config Folder

Controls how the application behaves

Important files:

config/database.yml – database connection

config/routes.rb – URL routing

config/application.rb – app configuration

config/environment.rb – app entry point

config/environments/

development.rb

test.rb

production.rb

🔹 DB Folder

Handles database logic

Important files:

db/migrate/ – migration files

db/schema.rb – current DB structure

db/seeds.rb – seed data

❌ Mistakes I Made (Day 3)

Ignored naming conventions

Tried editing schema.rb manually

Didn’t understand routes → controller → action flow
